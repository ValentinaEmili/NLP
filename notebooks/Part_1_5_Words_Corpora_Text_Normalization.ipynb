    "# Part_1_5_Words_Corpora_Text_Normalization\n",
    "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), key techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and sentence segmentation are fundamental for transforming raw text into a structured format that can be effectively analyzed by language models. Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization helps handle rare words and out-of-vocabulary terms by breaking text into subword units. Stemming, using algorithms like the Porter Stemmer, reduces words to their root forms, ensuring consistency across the text for better analysis. Sentence segmentation is crucial for dividing text into meaningful sentences, allowing for more accurate processing in downstream tasks. These techniques play a vital role in preparing text for various NLP tasks, ensuring that language data is in a normalized and analyzable state.\n",

    "### **Objectives:**\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, Parham will have a thorough understanding of tokenization and its importance in NLP, specifically learning how to implement **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** to handle words and subwords. He will explore the **Porter Stemmer**, gaining insight into how it reduces words to their base forms and why this is essential for text normalization. Additionally, Parham will learn to apply **Sentence Segmentation** to split text into meaningful sentences for deeper analysis. Through hands-on coding exercises, he will gain practical experience using these techniques, utilizing Python libraries like `NLTK` and `SpaCy` to prepare text for NLP tasks.\n",
