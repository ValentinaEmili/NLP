    "# **Part_1_7_Language Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the evolving field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), **Language Models** are foundational in generating, understanding, and analyzing text. From classic statistical models like `n-grams` to advanced Large Language Models (`LLMs`) like those powering modern conversational AI, language models shape applications across search engines, chatbots, summarization, translation, and more. This tutorial covers two main aspects of language models: **n-grams** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, along with hands-on exercises using the the **ChatGPT API** and **LangChain** to build sophisticated prompt engineering workflows.\n",

    "### **Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, Parham will:\n",
    "1. Gain an understanding of **n-gram language models**, their structure, and their role in basic text generation and probability-based language modeling.\n",
    "2. Develop a fundamental knowledge of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and their powerful role in NLP, including how they interpret and generate text in a human-like manner.\n",
    "3. Learn to interact with an LLM, specifically through the **ChatGPT API** and **LangChain**.\n",
    "4. Experiment with **prompt engineering** techniques to customize language model outputs, creating contextually relevant and refined responses.\n",
