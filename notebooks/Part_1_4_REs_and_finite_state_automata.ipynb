    "In Natural Language Processing (`NLP`), Finite Automata plays a crucial role in recognizing and processing patterns within text. They are used to model the sequence of states and transitions that a system undergoes in response to a string of inputs, making them particularly effective for tasks like lexical analysis, tokenization, and syntax parsing. The theory of Finite Automata is deeply intertwined with Regular Expressions (`Regex`), as every regular expression can be converted into an equivalent finite automaton, and vice versa. This relationship is significant because it provides a formal and efficient way to implement regex patterns using finite state machines. By understanding Finite Automata, Parham can gain insight into how `Regex` operate at a fundamental level, allowing him to better grasp how patterns are matched and how text is processed in various NLP tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, Parham will have learned the theory of finite automata and how to apply it in code. He will leverage the well-known Python library, `automata-lib`, to gain hands-on experience with the `Automaton` class. Subsequently, Parham will use the available functions of the library to convert finite automata patterns into `Regex` patterns. Additionally, various exception classes will be discussed to ensure that errors are handled appropriately.\n",

    "## 2) Introduction to the Theory of Finite Automata\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Automata are a foundational concept in computer science, particularly within formal language theory and natural language processing (NLP). A Finite Automaton is a simple computational model designed to recognize patterns within input data, making it crucial for tasks such as lexical analysis, pattern matching, and syntax parsing. Essentially, a Finite Automaton is an abstract machine that processes a sequence of input symbols, transitioning through a series of states according to a predefined set of rules. The machine comprises the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A finite set of states**: These represent the various configurations in which the machine can exist.\n",
    "- **An input alphabet**: A finite set of symbols that the machine can read and process.\n",
    "- **A transition function**: This defines how the machine moves from one state to another based on the current input symbol.\n",
    "- **A start state**: The initial state where the machine begins processing the input.\n",
    "- **Accepting (final) states**: Specific states that determine if the input is accepted (i.e., if the pattern is recognized) when the machine finishes processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of Finite Automata:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**: In a DFA, each state has exactly one transition for each possible input symbol. This ensures that for any given state and input, the next state is uniquely determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)**: In an NFA, a state may have multiple transitions for the same input symbol or may transition to a new state without consuming any input (Îµ-transitions). This non-determinism allows the NFA to explore multiple computational paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Converting a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system designed to detect a specific sequence of heads (H) and tails (T) from a series of coin tosses. The system is particularly interested in identifying a sequence where tails occur in the last two flips:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sequence = (H , T)* TT`\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to construct a state diagram that recognizes this sequence. The state diagram can be illustrated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"../imgs/finite_auto_diagram.png\" alt=\"Picture\" width=\"50%\" height=\"10%\" style=\"display: block; margin: 20px auto;\"/></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram above, each symbol is defined as follows:\n",
    "- **a** : \"Ends with heads\"\n",
    "- **b** : \"Ends with 1 tail\"\n",
    "- **c** : \"Ends with 2 tails\"\n",
    "- **e** : \"Error\"\n",
    "- **H** : Head\n",
    "- **T** : Tail\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simplified procedure that outlines how the system processes a sequence of heads (`H`) and tails (`T`) to detect when two consecutive tails (`TT`) occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start at State `a`:\n",
    "  - Initial state where the system begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If Input Symbol is `T`:\n",
    "  - If in State `a`:\n",
    "    - Transition to State `b`.\n",
    "  - If in State `b`:\n",
    "    - Transition to State `c` (final state).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If Input Symbol is `H`:\n",
    "  - From Any State (`a`, `b`, or `c`):\n",
    "    - Transition back to State `a`.\n",
    "- If Input Symbol is not one of `H` or `T`:\n",
    "  - From Any State (`a`, `b`, or `c`):\n",
    "      - Transition back to State `e`.\n",
    "- If in State `c` (Final State):\n",
    "  - Sequence \"TT\" has been detected, meaning the system has recognized the pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "The transition table for such system can be reported as below:\n",
    "| Current State/ Inputs | H               | T                                          | O.W |\n",
